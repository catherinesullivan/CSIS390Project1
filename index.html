<h2 class="pagetitle">Siena College Programming Contest</h2>
<p>The Siena College High School Programming Contest brings talented students from high schools 
throughout the Albany area to the campus. Contestants participate in a competition which will test their
 programming skills and problem solving abilities. Each high school is allowed to send one team.
 Contestants must be students currently attending that high school. Contests are generally
 held every March. And of course, there is tons of pizza!</p>
